## About Me
I am an appliction developer for GECS and a recent computer science graduate from the University of Michigan-Flint. I have a strong foundation in software development and programming that I am eager to apply in a dynamic production environment.

Throughout my coursework and industry experiences, I have gained skills in:
- Programming languages like C#, Java, Node.js, C++, and Python
- Building full stack applications 
- SQL and database design
- Testing and quality assurance

I am a problem-solver at heart and get a thrill from tackling complex issues. I love learning new things and working with smart, motivated teams.

In addition to my technical abilities, I bring strengths in communication, creativity, team collaboration, adaptability, and leadership.
